A motor on the robot baed on the AndyMark Neverest 40 motor.

This motor is based off of the AndyMark Neverest 40 motor, which produces
350 [ozf-in] (2.472 [Nm]) of torque at its max power. This simulation
assumes that the motors are connected to 4 [in] (0.1016 [m]) diameter wheels,
which yields an output force of 87.5 [ozf] (24.33 [N]).

Power values applied to the motor scale the output force linearly (this is
not technically correct; however, this isn't perfect yet).
